The solution is to ensure your component is part of the routing hierarchy.  Several approaches work:

1. **Directly within a Route Component:**
   The simplest solution is to place the code using `useNavigate` directly inside a component that is rendered by React Router, such as a component within a `<Route>` element.

2. **Lifting State Up:**
   If you can't place `useNavigate` directly in a route component, pass the navigation function as a prop from a component that *is* within a route.  The parent component uses `useNavigate` and passes it down to the child component that needs it. 

3. **Custom Hook (with caution):**
   While possible, using `useNavigate` inside a custom hook often leads to the original error. Only use this if you understand the implications; the hook must be used within a component that's part of the router context. This usually means using the hook in a component rendered via a route.

Example of solution (Lifting State Up):

```javascript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/home');
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Go to Home
    </button>
  );
}

function ParentComponent(){
    return(
        <Route path="/parent">
            <MyComponent/>
        </Route>
    );
}
```
