# React Router v6 useNavigate Hook Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `useNavigate` hook in React Router v6. The error, "useNavigate is not a function," occurs when `useNavigate` is called outside the context of a component rendered within a route.  The solution involves ensuring that the hook is used within a component directly or indirectly connected to the router context. This example shows the problem and the proper solution using React Router v6.
