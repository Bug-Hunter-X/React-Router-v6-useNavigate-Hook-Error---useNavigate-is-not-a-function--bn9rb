In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a function component that's not directly rendered by React Router.  For example, if you have a custom hook or a component nested deep within your application, calling `useNavigate` might result in `useNavigate is not a function`. This happens because `useNavigate` needs to be within a component that's part of the router context.
